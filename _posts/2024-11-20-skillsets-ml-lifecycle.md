One of the best charts explaining how skillsets are divided between ML lifecycle roles.
Firstly, business subject matter experts define the business use case based on insights coming from data analysts. Here, it is crucial the storytelling.
While data engineers focus on getting the best value from data sources and building data pipelines to clean data, data scientists take that output to build state-of-the-art ML models based on experimentation.
Finally, ML engineers take the ML model to optimize it, to make the best use of hardware resources (especially GPUs). Then they build the deployment pipeline to make it ready as a highly available API. This is what the client consumes.
