Mastering your company's AI lifecycle isn't easy.
It demands structure. Clear roles. Specialized expertise.
I help organizations integrate collaborative best practices
to transform AI models from experiments into production-ready
software products that deliver business value.

# My role

I am ML Engineer, my responsibility is to take machine learning models and transform them into production-ready systems. 
They optimize models to maximize hardware efficiency (especially GPUs), design and implement 
scalable ML pipelines, and collaborate to build robust deployment infrastructure to serve models as highly 
available APIs that clients consume.

## My tasks

* Build and integrate ML solutions for Sports Models in betting sector.
* Help build AI-powered automation tools or pipelines and propose improvements across the company 
* Own the full lifecycle of ML solutions: data ingestion / processing → feature engineering → model development → deployment → iteration
* Maintain and improve our existing codPassion for MLOps practices in deep learning product development. I work expanding our internal ML libraries and pipelines
* Continuously research and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and large language models, utilizing innovative techniques and methodologies to enhance  models.
* Take end to end ownership of large and scalable machine learning systems - from data pipelines, feature engineering, candidate extraction, model training, as well as integration into our production systems.
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to tackle complex use cases using agents and RAG pipelines
* I am fluent in English, and have excellent communication skills. I can explain complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical roles.
